Mesos includes a set of scripts in @MESOS_HOME/deploy@ that can be used to deploy it on a cluster. To use these scripts, you need to create two configuration files: @MESOS_HOME/conf/master@, which should contain the hostname of the node you want to be your master, and @MESOS_HOME/conf/slaves@, which should contain a list of hostnames (one per line) for your slaves. You can then start a cluster with @deploy/start-mesos@ and stop it with @deploy/stop-mesos@. Note that these scripts assume that Mesos is located in the same directory on all nodes.

It is also possible to set environment variables, ulimits, etc that will affect the master and slave. by editing @MESOS_HOME/deploy/mesos-env.sh@. One particularly useful one that we have used is @LIBPROCESS_IP@, which tells the master and slave binaries which IP address to bind to; in some installations, the default interface that the hostname resolves to is not a machine's external IP address, so you can set the right IP through this variable.

Finally, note that the deploy scripts currently do not allow you to launch multiple masters (when [[using ZooKeeper]]). However, you can use them to launch the first master and then start the other ones manually.
