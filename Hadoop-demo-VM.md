To make it easy for you to get started with Apache Mesos, we created a virtual machine with everything youneed. our VM runs Ubuntu 10.04 LTS - Long-term support 64-bit (Lucid Lynx) and Mesos with Apache Hadoop.

To launch the VMWare image, you will either need [VMware Player for Windows and Linux](http://www.vmware.com/go/downloadplayer/), or [VMware Fusion for Mac](http://www.vmware.com/products/fusion/). (Note that VMware Fusion only works on Intel architectures, so older Macs with PowerPC processors cannot run the training VM.)

Once you launch the VM, log in with the following account details:  

  - username: hadoop  
  - password: hadoop

The **hadoop** account has *sudo* privileges in the VM.
