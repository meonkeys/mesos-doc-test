We follow the [Google C++ Style Guide](http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/cppguide.xml) with the following differences:

### Variable Names
We use lowerCamelCase[1] for variable names (Google uses snake_case, and their class member variables have trailing underscores).

### Constant Names
We use lowerCamelCase[1] for constant names (Google uses a k followed by mixed case, e.g. kDaysInAWeek).

### Function Names
We use lowerCamelCase[1] for function names (Google uses mixed case for regular functions; and their accessors and mutators match the name of the variable).
