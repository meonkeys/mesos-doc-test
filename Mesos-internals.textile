* include - Contains headers that contain the interfaces that Mesos users need in order to interact with Mesos (e.g. the Mesos Framework API)
* src - Contains the entire Mesos source tree. See below for more details about the directories inside of @src@.
* third_party - Contains necessary open source third party software that Mesos leverages for things such as logging, etc.

h2. Mesos source code 

The Mesos source code (found in @MESOS_HOME/src@) is organized into the following hierarchy:

* conf - where the mesos configuration file @mesos.conf@ lives
* master - source files specific to the mesos-master daemon
* slave - source files specific to the mesos-slave daemon
* common - shared source files (such as utilities and data structures)
