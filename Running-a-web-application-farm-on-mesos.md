Mesos comes with a framework written in Python that will run a web load balancer ([[HAProxy|http://haproxy.1wt.eu/]]) and use apache for the backend servers. The framework is in MESOS_HOME/frameworks/haproxy+apache. There is a README in that directory that might be slightly helpful, but we recommend looking a the framework scheduler and executor code to familiarize yourself with the concepts behind the framework.

We have also successfully used Amazon's Elastic Load Balancer instead of HAProxy. This is still in a non-master development branch called [[andyk-elb+apache-notorque|https://github.com/mesos/mesos/tree/andyk-elb+apache-notorque]]
